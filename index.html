          Welcome to my website! I'm a 27-year-old computer science student
          living in Germany, enthusiastically exploring the depths of
          technology and its impact on our world. As you navigate through this
          digital space, you'll get a glimpse into my passions, projects, and
          pursuits.

        <p>
          Photography, my lifelong passion, allows me to encapsulate my
          friends, cities, and nature's beauty through my lens. Each picture
          is a unique expression of joy, urban charm, or natural splendor.
          Despite not always mirroring the astonishing images found online,
          each shot is a significant step in my artistic journey. Even as an amateur, the joy it brings is boundless.

          I invite you to check out my favorite shots <br> in my
          <a href="https://janfelixvs.myportfolio.com/">Adobe Portfolio</a> or for friends on my private <a

        <p>
          My passion for music is broad and ever-evolving. I find joy in
          exploring new artists, experiencing live concerts, and curating my
          personal playlists. In fact, one of my favorite collections of
          songs, which I've handpicked for their uniquely beautiful vibes, can
          be found on my
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/026m8lQwwjdl7JFQerE4H5?si=69f71b2ea5f04d77">Spotify playlist</a>.

        <p>
          I have a keen interest in video games, enjoying a wide range of
          genres that extend from the captivating storytelling in "God of
          War," to the urban design intricacies of "Cities Skylines," and the
          friendly competition in "Rocket League." On any gaming platform, I
          can typically be found under the username "janfelixvs." You might

          My primary experience is as a part-time Data Engineer, where I have

          an irregular hobby project. You also can find me on
