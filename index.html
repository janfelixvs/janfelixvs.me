            Welcome to my website! I'm a 26-year-old computer science student
            living in Germany, enthusiastically exploring the depths of
            technology and its impact on our world. As you navigate through this
            digital space, you'll get a glimpse into my passions, projects, and
            pursuits.

          <p>
            Photography has been a constant companion throughout my life, a
            pastime that allows me to frame the world through my unique
            perspective. Whether capturing the joy in my friends' expressions,
            finding beauty in nature's myriad forms, or focusing on the
            intricate details of the smaller wonders around us, each photograph
            tells its own story. While my passion for this art form remains a
            personal pursuit rather than a professional one, the joy it brings
            is immeasurable. For those interested, I invite you to explore the
            <a href="#photo-gallery">gallery</a> at the end of this site,
            showcasing a selection of my favorite captures.

          <h2>video games</h2>
          <p>
            I have a keen interest in video games, enjoying a wide range of
            genres that extend from the captivating storytelling in "God of
            War," to the urban design intricacies of "Cities Skylines," and the
            friendly competition in "Rocket League." On any gaming platform, I
            can typically be found under the username "janfelixvs." You might
            even come across me on

            My primary experience is as a part-time Data Engineer, where I have
            acquired significant proficiency with Java, Talend, and SQL.
            Alongside my professional and academic commitments, I pursue a
            personal interest in website development, maintaining my own site as
            an irregular hobby project. Though I only infrequently share
            projects publicly, some select works can be found on my
            <a href="https://github.com/janfelixvs">Github</a>.
